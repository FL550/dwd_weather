# Notice

The component and platforms in this repository are not meant to be used by a
user, but as a "blueprint" that custom component developers can build
upon, to make more awesome stuff.

This blueprint uses ['sampleclient'](https://github.com/ludeeus/sampleclient) to simulate what you actually might use in your integration.

HAVE FUN! ðŸ˜Ž

## Why?

This is simple, by having custom_components look (README + structure) the same
it is easier for developers to help each other and for users to start using them.

If you are a developer and you want to add things to this "blueprint" that you think more
developers will have use for, please open a PR to add it :)

## What?

This repository contains multiple files, here is a overview:

File | Purpose
-- | --
`.devcontainer/*` | Used for development/testing with VSCODE, more info in the readme file in that dir.
`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md` | Template for Feature Requests
`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/issue.md` | Template for issues
`.github/settings.yml` | Probot settings to control the repository settings.
`.vscode/tasks.json` | Tasks for the devcontainer.
`custom_components/blueprint/.translations/*` | [Translation files.](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/next/internationalization_custom_component_localization.html#translation-strings)
`custom_components/blueprint/__init__.py` | The component file for the integration.
`custom_components/blueprint/binary_sensor.py` | Binary sensor platform for the integration.
`custom_components/blueprint/config_flow.py` | Config flow file, this adds the UI configuration possibilities.
`custom_components/blueprint/const.py` | A file to hold shared variables/constants for the entire integration.
`custom_components/blueprint/manifest.json` | A [manifest file](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/creating_integration_manifest.html) for Home Assistant.
`custom_components/blueprint/sensor.py` | Sensor platform for the integration.
`custom_components/blueprint/switch.py` | Switch sensor platform for the integration.
`CONTRIBUTING.md` | Guidelines on how to contribute.
`example.png` | Screenshot that demonstrate how it might look in the UI.
`info.md` | An example on a info file (used by [hacs][hacs]).
`LICENSE` | The license file for the project.
`README.md` | The file you are reading now, should contain info about the integration, installation and configuration instructions.
`requirements.txt` | Python packages used by this integration.

## How?

If you want to use all the potential and features of this blueprint tempalte you
should use Visual Studio Code to develop in a container. In this container you
will have all the tools to ease your python development and a dedicated Home
Assistant core instance to run your integration. See `.devcontainer/README.md` for more information.

If you need to work on the python library in parallel of this integration
(`sampleclient` in this example) there are different options. The following one seems
easy to implement:

- Create a dedicated branch for your python library on a public git repository (example: branch
`dev` on `https://github.com/ludeeus/sampleclient`)
- Update in the `manifest.json` file the `requirements` key to point on your development branch
( example: `"requirements": ["git+https://github.com/ludeeus/sampleclient.git@dev#devp==0.0.1beta1"]`)
- Each time you need to make a modification to your python library, push it to your
development branch and increase the number of the python library version in `manifest.json` file
to ensure Home Assistant update the code of the python library. (example `"requirements": ["git+https://...==0.0.1beta2"]`).

_Component to integrate with [blueprint][blueprint]._

**This component will set up the following platforms.**

Platform | Description
-- | --
`binary_sensor` | Show something `True` or `False`.
`sensor` | Show info from blueprint API.
`switch` | Switch something `True` or `False`.

## Installation

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `blueprint`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/blueprint/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant
7. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Blueprint"

Using your HA configuration directory (folder) as a starting point you should now also have this:

```text
custom_components/blueprint/.translations/en.json
custom_components/blueprint/.translations/nb.json
custom_components/blueprint/.translations/sensor.nb.json
custom_components/blueprint/__init__.py
custom_components/blueprint/binary_sensor.py
custom_components/blueprint/config_flow.py
custom_components/blueprint/const.py
custom_components/blueprint/manifest.json
custom_components/blueprint/sensor.py
custom_components/blueprint/switch.py
```

## Configuration is done in the UI
