<!-- Before you open a new issue, search through the existing issues to see if others have had the same problem.

Issues not containing the minimum requirements will be closed, because without this help is nearly impossible:

- Issues without a description (using the header is not good enough) will be closed.
- Issues without debug logging will be closed.
